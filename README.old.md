# Web Calculator using React

Welcome to our web calculator project! Your first task is to build a web calculator using React. In this README.md file, I'll give you an overview of the project and what is expected from you.

## Project Overview
The project is a simple web calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should have a user-friendly interface and be responsive to different screen sizes. The main goal of this project is to introduce you to the basics of React and give you hands-on experience in building a simple web application.

## Project Requirements
The following are the requirements for the web calculator project:

The calculator should have a user-friendly interface with clear and easy-to-read buttons and displays.
The calculator should perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The calculator should handle decimal numbers.
The calculator should be responsive to different screen sizes.
The calculator should have clear and easy-to-understand code.

## Getting Started
If you're new to React, I recommend that you first go through the official React documentation, especially [quick start guide](https://react.dev/learn). 

Once you have a basic understanding of React, you can start working on the web calculator project. I recommend that you use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to create a new React project. Create React App is a tool that helps you set up a new React project quickly and easily.

## Submission
Besides completed task, submit a brief report describing your approach to the project, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

## Conclusion
I hope that this project will be a valuable learning experience for you. If you have any questions or concerns about the project, feel free to reach out to me (Michal) or to Honza.
